# JavaScript Mini Projects
### This is a repo for all my mini projects that I make during my learning of JavaScript

1. First mini project is a simple calculator type of application that has two hard coded variables with four mathematical operators. Based on the user's choice of operator, the final sum would change.

3. Third mini project is a passenger counter tool that can be used to keep track of people entering a platform or bus or venue. One button increments the counter while the other saves the counter and resets it for the next set of people.
