# JavaScript Projects
### This is a repo for all my projects and mini projects that I make during my JavaScript learning. *[Newest - Oldest]*
6. This project is a calculator with basic arithmatic functionalities. It takes user inputs and stores it as string. Then using the JavaScript's eval() function, I evaluate the result of the eqaution and output the result. I also added a delete buttton (Del) to remove the last input of the user.

5. This mini project was a Chrome Extension that serves similar to a bookmark feature. Links of the current tab can be saved into a list while also having the ability to save any other links using the input box. These are stored in local storage so it stays there even after tab refresh.

3. This mini project is a passenger counter tool that can be used to keep track of people entering a platform or bus or venue. One button increments the counter while the other saves the counter and resets it for the next set of people.

2. This mini project is similar to old DVD logo bouncing between the edges of the screen. Number of randomly sized bubbles with randomly picked colour from an array, bounce between the designated canvas with varying speed.

1. This mini project is a simple calculator type of application that has two hard coded variables with four mathematical operators. Based on the user's choice of operator, the final sum would change.
